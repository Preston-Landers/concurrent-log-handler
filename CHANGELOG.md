## Change Log ##
- 0.9.21: Added new optional parameter "lock_file_directory"
    * Creates given directory, if it does not exist.
    * Writes lock file into given directory, instead next to the logging file itself.
- 0.9.20: Threaded logging queue now uses asyncio and can be used after fork (PR#32).
    * The classifiers have been updated to indicate generic Python 3 support without needing to
      specify all sub-versions. (However, Python 3.0 to 3.4 support is not claimed.)
    * Better performance with large values for backupCount (number of rotated files to keep).
    * You can set the file owner / group to 'root' (uid 0)
    * Test script has been made more reliable.

- 0.9.19: Fix Python 2 compatibility (again), thanks @buddly27 Fix accidental detection of '
  darwin' (Mac OS) as Windows in setup.py

- 0.9.18: Remove ez_setup from the setup.py

- 0.9.17: Contains the following fixes:
    * Catch exceptions when unlocking the lock.
    * Clarify documentation, esp. with use of multiprocessing
    * In Python 2, don't request/allow portalocker 2.0 which won't work.  (Require portalocker<
      =1.7.1)

  NOTE: the next release will likely be a 1.0 release candidate.

- 0.9.16: Fix publishing issue with incorrect code included in the wheel Affects Python 2 mainly -
  see Issue #21

- 0.9.15: Fix bug from last version on Python 2. (Issue #21) Thanks @condontrevor Also, on Python 2
  and 3, apply unicode_error_policy (default: ignore) to convert a log message to the output
  stream's encoding. I.e., by default it will filter out (remove) any characters in a log message
  which cannot be converted to the output logfile's encoding.

- 0.9.14: Fix writing LF line endings on Windows when encoding is specified. Added newline and
  terminator kwargs to allow customizing line ending behavior. Thanks to @vashek

- 0.9.13: Fixes Crashes with ValueError: I/O operation on closed file (issue #16)
  Also should fix issue #13 with crashes related to Windows file locking. Big thanks to
  @terencehonles, @nsmcan, @wkoot, @dismine for doing the hard parts

- 0.9.12: Add umask option (thanks to @blakehilliard)
  This adds the ability to control the permission flags when creating log files.

- 0.9.11: Fix issues with gzip compression option (use buffering)

- 0.9.10: Fix inadvertent lock sharing when forking Thanks to @eriktews for this fix

- 0.9.9: Fix Python 2 compatibility broken in last release

- 0.9.8: Bug fixes and permission features
    * Fix for issue #4 - AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write' This error could
      be caused if a rollover occurred inside a logging statement that was generated from within
      another logging statement's format() call.
    * Fix for PyWin32 dependency specification (explicitly require PyWin32)
    * Ability to specify owner and permissions (mode) of rollover files [Unix only]

- 0.9.7/0.9.6: Fix platform specifier for PyPi

- 0.9.5: Add `use_gzip` option to compress rotated logs. Add an optional threaded logging queue
  handler based on the standard library's `logging.QueueHandler`.

- 0.9.4: Fix setup.py to not include tests in distribution.

- 0.9.3: Refactoring release
    * For publishing fork on pypi as `concurrent-log-handler` under new package name.
    * NOTE: PyWin32 is required on Windows but is not an explicit dependency because the PyWin32
      package is not currently installable through pip.
    * Fix lock behavior / race condition

- 0.9.2: Initial release of fork by Preston Landers based on a fork of Lowell Alleman's
  ConcurrentLogHandler 0.9.1
    * Fixes deadlocking issue with recent versions of Python
    * Puts `.__` prefix in front of lock file name
    * Use `secrets` or `SystemRandom` if available.
    * Add/fix Windows support
