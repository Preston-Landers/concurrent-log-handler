"""concurrent_log_handler: A smart replacement for the standard RotatingFileHandler

ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler:  This class is a log handler which is a drop-in
replacement for the python standard log handler 'RotateFileHandler', the primary
difference being that this handler will continue to write to the same file if
the file cannot be rotated for some reason, whereas the RotatingFileHandler will
strictly adhere to the maximum file size.  Unfortunately, if you are using the
RotatingFileHandler on Windows, you will find that once an attempted rotation
fails, all subsequent log messages are dropped.  The other major advantage of
this module is that multiple processes can safely write to a single log file.

To put it another way:  This module's top priority is preserving your log
records, whereas the standard library attempts to limit disk usage, which can
potentially drop log messages. If you are trying to determine which module to
use, there are number of considerations: What is most important: strict disk
space usage or preservation of log messages? What OSes are you supporting? Can
you afford to have processes blocked by file locks?

Concurrent access is handled by using file locks, which should ensure that log
messages are not dropped or clobbered. This means that a file lock is acquired
and released for every log message that is written to disk. (On Windows, you may
also run into a temporary situation where the log file must be opened and closed
for each log message.) This can have potentially performance implications. In my
testing, performance was more than adequate, but if you need a high-volume or
low-latency solution, I suggest you look elsewhere.

Warning: see notes in the README.md about changing rotation settings like maxBytes.
If different processes are writing to the same file, they should all have the same
settings at the same time, or unexpected behavior may result. This may mean that if you
change the logging settings at any point you may need to restart your app service
so that all processes are using the same settings at the same time.

This module currently only support the 'nt' and 'posix' platforms due to the
usage of the portalocker module.  I do not have access to any other platforms
for testing, patches are welcome.

See the README file for an example usage of this module.

This module supports Python 3.6 and later.
(Support for older version was dropped in 0.9.23.)

            Avoid setting this very high, probably 20 or less, and prefer setting maxBytes higher.
            A very large number of rollover files can slow down the rollover enough to cause
            problems due to the mass file renaming while the main lock is held.

            This is an alternative to chmod. It is mainly for Unix systems but
            can also be used on Windows. The Windows security model is more complex
            and this is not the same as changing access control entries.
        :param newline: None (default): use CRLF on Windows, LF on Unix. Set to '' for
        no translation, in which case the 'terminator' argument determines the line ending.
        :param terminator: set to '\r\n' along with newline='' to force Windows style
        newlines regardless of OS platform.
        :param unicode_error_policy: should be one of 'ignore', 'replace', 'strict'
        Determines what happens when a message is written to the log that the stream encoding
        doesn't support. Default is to ignore, i.e., drop the unusable characters.
        :param lock_file_directory: name of directory for all lock files as alternative
        living space; this is useful for when the main log files reside in a cloud synced
        drive like Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Docs, etc., which may prevent the lock files
        from working correctly. The lock file must be accessible to all processes writing
        to a shared log, including across all different hosts (machines).

        By default, the file grows indefinitely. You can specify particular
        values of maxBytes and backupCount to allow the file to rollover at
        a predetermined size.

        Rollover occurs whenever the current log file is nearly maxBytes in
        length. If backupCount is >= 1, the system will successively create
        new files with the same pathname as the base file, but with extensions
        ".1", ".2" etc. appended to it. For example, with a backupCount of 5
        and a base file name of "app.log", you would get "app.log",
        "app.log.1", "app.log.2", ... through to "app.log.5". The file being
        written to is always "app.log" - when it gets filled up, it is closed
        and renamed to "app.log.1", and if files "app.log.1", "app.log.2" etc.
        exist, then they are renamed to "app.log.2", "app.log.3" etc.
        respectively.

        If maxBytes is zero, rollover never occurs.

        This log handler assumes that all concurrent processes logging to a
        single file will are using only this class, and that the exact same
        parameters are provided to each instance of this class.  If, for
        example, two different processes are using this class, but with
        different values for 'maxBytes' or 'backupCount', then odd behavior is
        expected. The same is true if this class is used by one application, but
        the RotatingFileHandler is used by another.
