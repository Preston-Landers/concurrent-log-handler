Description: 
        Overview
        ========
        This package provides an additional log handler for Python's standard logging
        package (PEP 282). This handler will write log events to a log file which is
        rotated when the log file reaches a certain size.  Multiple processes can
        safely write to the same log file concurrently. Rotated logs can be gzipped
        if enabled.  Both Windows and POSIX systems are supported. An optional threaded
        queue logging handler is provided to perform logging in the background.

        This is a fork from Lowell Alleman's version with updates for Windows and
        recent versions of Python. It should be a drop-in replacement for users
        of the old version, except for changing the package name from
        `cloghandler` to `concurrent_log_handler`.

        Note: PyWin32 is required on Windows, but can't be installed as an
        automatic dependency because it's not currently installable through pip.
        
        Details
        =======
        .. _portalocker:  http://code.activestate.com/recipes/65203/
        
        The ``ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler`` class is a drop-in replacement for
        Python's standard log handler ``RotatingFileHandler``. This module uses file
        locking so that multiple processes can concurrently log to a single file without
        dropping or clobbering log events. This module provides a file rotation scheme
        like with ``RotatingFileHanler``.  Extra care is taken to ensure that logs
        can be safely rotated before the rotation process is started. (This module works
        around the file rename issue with ``RotatingFileHandler`` on Windows, where a
        rotation failure means that all subsequent log events are dropped).
        
        This module attempts to preserve log records at all cost. This means that log
        files will grow larger than the specified maximum (rotation) size. So if disk
        space is tight, you may want to stick with ``RotatingFileHandler``, which will
        strictly adhere to the maximum file size.
        
        If you have multiple instances of a script (or multiple scripts) all running at
        the same time and writing to the same log file, then *all* of the scripts should
        be using ``ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler``. You should not attempt to mix
        and match ``RotatingFileHandler`` and ``ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler``.
        
        This package bundles `portalocker`_ to deal with file locking.
        On Windows this requires PyWin32 installed separately.

        Installation
        ============
        Use the following command to download and install this package::
        
            pip install concurrent-log-handler
        
        If you are installing from source, you can use::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Simple Example
        --------------
        Here is a example demonstrating how to use this module directly (from within
        Python code)::
        
            from logging import getLogger, INFO
            from concurrent_log_handler import ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler
            import os
            
            log = getLogger()
            # Use an absolute path to prevent file rotation trouble.
            logfile = os.path.abspath("mylogfile.log")
            # Rotate log after reaching 512K, keep 5 old copies.
            rotateHandler = ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler(logfile, "a", 512*1024, 5)
            log.addHandler(rotateHandler)
            log.setLevel(INFO)
            
            log.info("Here is a very exciting log message, just for you")
        
        
        Automatic fallback example
        --------------------------
        If you are distributing your code and you are unsure if the
        `concurrent_log_handler` package has been installed everywhere your code will run,
        Python makes it easy to gracefully fallback to the built in
        `RotatingFileHandler`, here is an example::
        
            try:
                from concurrent_log_handler import ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler as RFHandler
            except ImportError:
                # Next 2 lines are optional:  issue a warning to the user
                from warnings import warn
                warn("concurrent_log_handler package not installed.  Using builtin log handler")
                from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler as RFHandler
            
            log = getLogger()
            rotateHandler = RFHandler("/path/to/mylogfile.log", "a", 1048576, 15)
            log.addHandler(rotateHandler)
        
        
        
        Config file example
        -------------------
        This example shows you how to use this log handler with the logging config file
        parser. This allows you to keep your logging configuration code separate from
        your application code.
        
        Example config file: ``logging.ini``::
        
            [loggers]
            keys=root
            
            [handlers]
            keys=hand01
            
            [formatters]
            keys=form01
            
            [logger_root]
            level=NOTSET
            handlers=hand01
            
            [handler_hand01]
            class=handlers.ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler
            level=NOTSET
            formatter=form01
            args=("rotating.log", "a", 512*1024, 5)
            
            [formatter_form01]
            format=%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s
        
        Example Python code: ``app.py``::
        
            import logging, logging.config
            import concurrent_log_handler
            
            logging.config.fileConfig("logging.ini")
            log = logging.getLogger()
            log.info("Here is a very exciting log message, just for you")

           * Big thanks to Dan Callaghan for forwarding these issues and patches.
        
        - 0.9.0:  Now requires Python 2.6+
           * Revamp file opening/closing and file-locking internals (inspired by
             feedback from Vinay Sajip.)

        - 0.8.6:  Fixed packaging bug with test script
           * Fix a small packaging bug from the 0.8.5 release.  (Thanks to Björn Häuser
             for bringing this to my attention.)
           * Updated stresstest.py to always use the correct python version when
             launching sub-processes instead of the system's default "python".
        
        - 0.8.5:  Fixed ValueError: I/O operation on closed file
           * Thanks to Vince Carney, Arif Kasim, Matt Drew, Nick Coghlan, and
             Dan Callaghan for bug reports.  Bugs can now be filled here:
             https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-concurrent-log-handler.  Bugs resolved
             `Red Hat Bug #858912`_ and `Python Bug #15960`_
           * Updated ez_setup.py to 0.7.7
           * Updated portalocker to 0.3 (now maintained by Rick van Hattem)
           * Initial Python 3 support (needs more testing)
           * Fixed minor spelling mistakes
        
        - 0.8.4:  Fixed lock-file naming issue
           * Resolved a minor issue where lock-files would be improperly named if the
             log file contained ".log" in the middle of the log name.  For example, if
             you log file was "/var/log/mycompany.logging.mysource.log", the lock file
             would be named "/var/log/mycompany.ging.mysource.lock", which is not correct.
             Thanks to Dirk Rothe for pointing this out.  Since this introduce a slight 
             lock-file behavior difference, make sure all concurrent writers are updated
             to 0.8.4 at the same time if this issue effects you.
           * Updated ez_setup.py to 0.6c11
        
        - 0.8.3:  Fixed a log file rotation bug and updated docs
           * Fixed a bug that happens after log rotation when multiple processes are
             witting to the same log file. Each process ends up writing to their own
             log file ("log.1" or "log.2" instead of "log"). The fix is simply to reopen
             the log file and check the size again.  I do not believe this bug results in
             data loss; however, this certainly was not the desired behavior.  (A big
             thanks goes to Oliver Tonnhofer for finding, documenting, and providing a
             patch for this bug.)
           * Cleanup the docs. (aka "the page you are reading right now") I fixed some
             silly mistakes and typos... who writes this stuff?
        
        - 0.8.2:  Minor bug fix release (again)
           * Found and resolved another issue with older logging packages that do not
             support encoding.
        
        - 0.8.1:  Minor bug fix release
           * Now importing "codecs" directly; I found some slight differences in the
             logging module in different Python 2.4.x releases that caused the module to
             fail to load.
        
        - 0.8.0:  Minor feature release
            * Add better support for using ``logging.config.fileConfig()``. This class
              is now available using ``class=handlers.ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler``.
            * Minor changes in how the ``filename`` parameter is handled when given a
              relative path.
        
        - 0.7.4:  Minor bug fix
            * Fixed a typo in the package description (incorrect class name)
            * Added a change log; which you are reading now.
            * Fixed the ``close()`` method to no longer assume that stream is still
              open.
        
        To-do
        =====
        * This module has had minimal testing in a multi-threaded process.  I see no
          reason why this should be an issue, but no stress-testing has been done in a
          threaded situation. If this is important to you, you could always add
          threading support to the ``stresstest.py`` script and send me the patch.

        * Update: this works in a multi-process concurrency environment but I have
          not tested it extensively with threads or async, but that should be handled
          by the parent logging class.
